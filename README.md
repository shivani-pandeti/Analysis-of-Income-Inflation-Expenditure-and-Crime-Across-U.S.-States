# 📊 Analysis of Income, Inflation, Expenditure, and Crime Across U.S. States

## 📌 Overview
This project presents a **data-driven analysis of socio-economic factors across U.S. states**, focusing on the relationship between **income levels, inflation, household expenditure, and crime rates**.

By combining multiple public datasets and applying exploratory data analysis and statistical modeling, the project aims to uncover **patterns, correlations, and regional disparities** that influence crime and economic well-being across states.


## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Analyze income, inflation, and expenditure trends across U.S. states  
- Examine how economic conditions relate to crime rates  
- Identify state-level and regional patterns  
- Support insights using data visualization and statistical analysis  


## 🧠 Problem Statement
Socio-economic indicators such as income and inflation significantly impact living conditions and social outcomes. However, these relationships vary widely across regions and are often misunderstood when analyzed in isolation.

This project addresses the problem by:
- Integrating multiple economic and crime datasets  
- Analyzing relationships at the **state level**  
- Using data to support evidence-based socio-economic insights  


## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:**  
  - pandas, numpy  
  - matplotlib, seaborn  
  - scikit-learn  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook  
- **Data Format:** CSV  


## 📊 Dataset Description
The analysis uses a combined dataset containing:
- Median household income  
- Inflation indicators  
- Consumer expenditure patterns  
- Crime statistics by U.S. state  

The final dataset is cleaned, standardized, and structured to enable meaningful cross-state comparisons.


## 🔄 Methodology
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Feature selection and transformation  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Correlation and trend analysis  
- Statistical and regression-based modeling  


## 📈 Key Insights
- Economic indicators vary significantly across states and regions  
- Higher income does not always correlate with lower crime rates  
- Inflation and expenditure patterns influence economic pressure differently by state  
- Regional clustering highlights structural socio-economic differences  


## 🚀 Use Cases
- Public policy and socio-economic analysis  
- Data analytics and visualization portfolio project  
- Academic research and coursework  
- State-level comparative analysis  


## 📌 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how **integrated data analysis** can reveal complex relationships between economic conditions and social outcomes.  
By combining multiple indicators into a unified analytical framework, it highlights the importance of **context-aware, data-driven decision-making** in socio-economic studies.
